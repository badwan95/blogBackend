### How to initialize the application

* Before you start for the first time, you need to install the node modules, you can do that after downloading the repository then `npm i`, this will install all the dependencies needed.

* You need to create an environment file `.env` and add to it all the following keys: (PORT,TOKEN_TIMEOUT,SECRET,MONGODB_URI), if you don't have those keys contact me.

* `npm run start` to start the application.
